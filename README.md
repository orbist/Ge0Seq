MIDI to CV with Sequencer

The source code and releases for the Ge0Seq sequencer used by the Ge0synchronous Synths TB-Seq Eurorack module and embedded in the Ge0sync Desktop semi-modular synthesisers.

Running on an Arduino or Atmega328P based system, this provides basic MIDI to CV note conversion, clock in/out (out based on MIDI clock) with trigger and gate.
Additional outputs for V/Oct conversion from MIDI input, or generated by the internal 16 step sequencer. Accent output for sequencer steps. Modulation output configurable to different MIDI CC inputs (CC1 by default - mod wheel)

Configurable PPQN In and Out, with V/Oct scaling adjustment, and various configurable parameters via internal menu system.

Sequencer can contain up to 8 different 1-16 step sequences, with one active sequence at at point in time.

Sequences and settings can be uploaded via MIDI SysEx messages from the companion Ge0sync Sequence Editor application. https://github.com/orbist/Ge0Seq-Editor

Thanks to Larry McGovern - the basic MIDI 2 CV handling is based on his project : https://github.com/elkayem/midi2cv and the Menu system from his USB MIDI 2 CV project.
